# OracleDAO

## Introduction

OracleDAO is a proposal smart contract, aimed and coordinating efforts to build tools and market Augur, and its token REP.
It is expected this DAO will propose funding of marketing, research, and engineering related to the Augur project. This DAO will
follow the traditions of MolochDAO, focusing on positive externality projects to improve value for REP holders and users of Augur.
DAO members will be expected to pay tribute in DAI, and vote on proposals to fund projects. Also following the tradition of MolochDAO,
members must get approval from other members to join, may withdraw at any time, and may be removed from the DAO by vote from other members.
To fund the OracleDAO, members must join with at least ◈2000 tribute, and will receive 10 shares.

## Purpose

### Augur is more than a smart contract

Augur's smart contract has shown a use case for an open, decentralized prediction market accessible to the entire world. Since July 2018,
Augur has seen over Ξ70,000 in volume from only slightly over 2000 users, showing a strong user base willing to help predict on future
events risking their own monetary value. While this growth has been positive, it is clear other components are necessary to capture more
users and drive volume, increasing the value of the REP token.

### Why another DAO? Why not let the Forecast Foundation do this?

During this rise, it has become clear development is seeing a tragedy of commons. The Forecast Foundation is primarily focused on developing
the core UI to connect to Augur. While this development is active and strong, other quality of life tools that also connect to Augur or could
improve the quality of Augur have not appeared. This is primarily due to the Forecast Foundation's size and limited engineering and marketing
resources. Other's have begun to build tools and market Augur, but those attempts are highly centralized and at any point could be removed,
significantly reducing the quality of life of Augur's users and REP holders. Not only this, these quality of life improvements could be worked
on in parallel of V2.

### Enter oracleDAO

OracleDAO could immediately change this. OracleDAO could help scale engineering by hiring external consultants to improve the product,
or fund development of open-source tools that connect to and use Augur. Not only this, but an external aid to the Forecast Foundation
to aid in non-engineering tasks could allow for a separation of concerns which allows the Foundation to focus solely on the main UI and
smart contract development. Members of OracleDAO can have direct say in what projects are funded to improve Augur, and are not beholden
to the Forecast Foundation's product roadmap, which may push out projects that are high value, but not a main focus of the Foundation.

### Examples

The community of Augur has seen development of UI tools to explore Augur's markets and traders. Along with this, Augur's source code is open,
so anyone could develop directly on the platform. What is clear is there could be more development to reach Augur's goal of being the largest
trading market in the world. Below are some examples of projects that could improve Augur in it's current phase:

* A better "scanner" tool. [ExploreAugur](https://exploreaugur.com/) and [Predictions.Global](https://predictions.global/) are main tools used in viewing Augur markets, but the maintainers of the code have no incentive to improve site quality. Directly paying them and funding development may be useful for users of Augur.
* Language improvements to Augur would directly improve the scope of Augur. At the moment, English is the primary language. Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Hindi, Arabic, or Swahili could be targets for future language improvements.
* Directly paying high profile influencers to promote Augur could also be good. Youtube videos are costly to produce, and there could be strong incentives to pay influencers to give audiences tutorials and tours of the Augur platform. This is also a good opportunity to introduce users in non-English speaking countries to Augur.

## Governance

MolochDAO's tradition is that members pay tribute to the DAO, in order to receive voting shares. At any time, members can burn their
shares and receive an equivalent percentage of the tribute pool. Members must also vote new members in by giving them shares. At its core,
this gives a simple mechanic for funding projects.

1. Members recognize a project will improve their overall aggregated value. Members put a price on how much this could improve their value.
2. Members vote a new external consultant to become a member of the DAO and implement the project. New shares are created and given to the new member, whose total value is equivalent to the project cost. Since the project cost is usually less than the overall value gained by the members, it is profitable for them to do so.
3. Upon completion of the project, Members distribute shares to the consultant. The consultant then burns their shares, withdrawing payment.

For REP holders case, a more concrete example may be that REP holders believe a new language may improve the value. OracleDAO members vote a
consultant to work on a new language in the Augur UI, and pay them shares equivalent to ◈10000 upon completion. If the aggregated pool of
shares is now dilluted, but overall, members of the DAO who may be REP holders or Market Makers capture this value in REP price or market
volume, the project is profitable.

There are more details about governance, but members should see MolochDAO's whitepaper, and prepare for a fork to be summoned in the near future. At the start, members should be expected to tribute at least ◈2000 to join.

## Communication

OracleDAO should focus on decentralized communication. Members should seek tools which can be redistributed and created if destroyed. Telegram
and HackMD should be the main tools, since Telegram is a common communication tool, and HackMD utilizes github repositories, which can be forked
and hosted at any time.
