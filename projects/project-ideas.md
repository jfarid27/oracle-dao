# Project Ideas

###### tags: `Project` `Planning` `AIP`

Projects should start with an idea, then be transfered to an
AIP (Augur Improvement Proposal). AIP's should have well defined goals
and a clear Definition of Done that members of the DAO can evaluate and
verify as completed. Cost should be seen as the value of tokens to award
completers of the AIP. It should be clear completed projects must be funded,
or members of the DAO will ragequit (see [Collapsing the firm](https://medium.com/@simondlr/the-moloch-dao-collapsing-the-firm-2a800b3aa2e7)).

This list should include a list of project ideas with rough estimates of cost. When AIP's are created, link them here.
