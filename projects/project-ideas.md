# Project Ideas

###### tags: `Project` `Planning` `AIP`

Projects should start with an idea, then be transfered to an
AIP (Augur Improvement Proposal). AIP's should have well defined goals
and a clear Definition of Done that members of the DAO can evaluate and
verify as completed.

This list should include a list of project ideas with rough estimates of cost. When AIP's are created, link them here.
