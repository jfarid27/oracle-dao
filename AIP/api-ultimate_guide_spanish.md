## Simple Summary
To help with promoting Augur, we should fund translation of [Ben Davidow's Ultimate Guide to Augur](https://www.augur.net/blog/prediction-markets/) to the Spanish language.

## Abstract
A large portion of the world speaks Spanish as a native language. It would be beneficial to translate the Ultimate Guide to Augur. This translation could be circulated to various blogs, and possibly hosted by Augur.net.

## Motivation
At the moment, the Forecast Foundation is focused on V2 development efforts. A large re-write of materials is likely not a good use of
their resources. This particular project would likely help expose Spanish speaking countries in Latin America and Europe to Prediction
Market Technologies, as well as improve the volume, and price, of Augur.

## Definition  of Done

* Produce a Markdown file in the OracleDAO repo with a spanish translation of the Ultimate Guide.
* The translation should include image tags at appropriate locations matching the English Ultimate Guide.
* The translation should be available for the Forecast Foundation to add to the augur.net website.

## Specification
1. Translate the Ultimate Guide into Spanish.
2. The translation should be generally accessible to most Spanish speakers using common language.
3. The translation should be signed off ok from a Spanish speaking Member, or a group of people Members can trust.
4. The translation should be added as a pull request into the OracleDAO's Github repository for the public to fork and pull.

## Rationale

#### Why select this blog post to translate?

The Ultimate Guide is a good general introduction to Augur and Prediction Markets, highlighting motivations for using Prediction Markets
as a public good. It also showcases an example of a binary market which could be a good introduction for newcomers to the Prediction Market
space.

#### Should we specify a specific version of Spanish?

At the time of writing, I don't have a good answer to this. I am not familiar with Spanish dialects, but I do know they exist. It is important
to write a version of Spanish that may be accessible to the most users.

## Costs

The Ultimate guide has roughly 3,400 words. Quick estimates show professional translation charges $0.12USD per word. This prices this task
at roughly $408.48. Implementers of this task should receive OracleDAO tokens equivalent to â—ˆ500 at the time of completion, to
account for follow up work and delivery.

## Risks

#### Legal

There is a possibility this could be seen as advertising betting markets from certain jurisdictions. Is the Howey Test relevant here?



#### Completion

Without a member of the DAO that isn't Spanish speaking, it could be
difficult to validate correctness of the translation.
