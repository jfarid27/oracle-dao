# AIP Template

###### tags: AIP Project Template

README:

This is the suggested template for new AIPs. Note AIPs are generated
in the spirit of EIPs, but obviously can address open-ended social
problems instead of techical problems.

Submit a Pull-Request to a member fork of the OracleDAO repo, and place it in the AIP folder.

Note that an AIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your AIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `AIP/aip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

Copy the proposal below and fill it out!

# AIP-1

## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the AIP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation section should clearly explain why existing tools,
frameworks, or resources do not address the problem that the AIP
solves. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be
rejected outright.

## Definition  of Done

The Definition of Done must explicitly list, as best as possible,
what the goals of the AIP's implementation should be. There should
be as little uncertainty as possible, and AIP's should not have subjective goals.

## Specification
The specification should describe tasks, whether technical or
non-technical, to reach the AIP's Definition of Done. The specification
should be as clear as possible to help DAO members predict costs
and timelines for the AIP.

## Costs

Cost considerations should be included in the specification. Costs
should include estimates of time and money, and provide clear examples,
pricing information, and if possible, cost details of related projects.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
