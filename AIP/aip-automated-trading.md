## Simple Summary
To help with promoting Augur, we should fund translation of [Ben Davidow's Ultimate Guide to Augur](https://www.augur.net/blog/prediction-markets/) to the Hindi language.

## Abstract
Recent developments have legalized cryptocurrency purchasing in India. To
help market Augur to Indian users, we should seek to translate this document
to Hindi.

## Motivation
India represents a large portion of the world economy and population.
Exposing India to decentralized prediction markets could aid with increasing
on-platform users, as well as expose them to a new financial system through
decentralized finance. Use cases in hedging prices, buying insurance, and
sports are extremely obvious for users in this area. It is likely a large
group of users may benefit from a decentralized prediction market, and aiding
in education about the benefits and uses of Augur may be helpful.

## Definition  of Done

* Produce a Markdown file in the OracleDAO repo with a Hindi translation of the Ultimate Guide.
* The translation should include image tags at appropriate locations matching the English Ultimate Guide.
* The translation should be available for the Forecast Foundation to add to the augur.net website.

## Specification
1. Translate the Ultimate Guide into Hindi.
2. The translation should be generally accessible to most Hindi speakers using common language.
3. The translation should be signed off ok from a Hindi speaking Member, or a person Members can trust.
4. The translation should be added as a pull request into the OracleDAO's Github repository for the public to fork and pull.

## Risks

None

## Rationale

#### Why select this blog post to translate?

The Ultimate Guide is a good general introduction to Augur and Prediction Markets, highlighting motivations for using Prediction Markets
as a public good. It also showcases an example of a binary market which could be a good introduction for newcomers to the Prediction Market
space.

#### Should we specify a specific dialect of Hindi or other Indian languages?

At the time of writing, Hindi and English are official languages, but it is
well known that other languages are popular in India. It is likely we may
discuss a different language to translate, but it appears Hindi would be
the better choice at the moment.

## Costs

The Ultimate guide has roughly 3,400 words. Quick estimates show professional translation charges $0.12USD per word. This prices this task
at roughly $408.48. Implementers of this task should receive OracleDAO tokens 
equivalent to â—ˆ500 at the time of completion, to account for follow up work
and delivery.
